              My therapeutic approach integrates two powerful modalities: Internal Family Systems (IFS) and Somatic Experiencing (SE). This combination creates a holistic healing process that honors both the psychological and physiological aspects of your experience.

              <p className="text-gray-300">
                Healing requires addressing both the mind and body. By combining IFS and SE, we create a comprehensive approach that helps you connect with all parts of yourself while also releasing trauma stored in your body. This integration allows for deeper, more sustainable healing than either approach could achieve alone.

                <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                  IFS helps us identify and work with the different "parts" of your internal system:

                  SE addresses how trauma and stress are stored in your nervous system:

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-light text-white mb-6 text-center">Key Elements of My Integrated Approach</h3>
            
            <div className="space-y-6 mb-10">
              <div className="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg">
                <h4 className="text-xl font-medium text-white mb-3">1. Recognizing the Body's Response to Parts</h4>
                <p className="text-gray-300">
                  I help you notice how different parts of your internal system manifest in your body—perhaps as tension in your shoulders, a knot in your stomach, or a fluttering in your chest. By bringing awareness to these physical sensations, we can identify which parts are activated and what they might need.
                </p>
              </div>
              
              <div className="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg">
                <h4 className="text-xl font-medium text-white mb-3">2. Pendulation for Emotional Regulation</h4>
                <p className="text-gray-300">
                  Using the SE technique of pendulation, we move gently between activating and calming experiences. This prevents overwhelm when exploring difficult emotions or memories, allowing your nervous system to process experiences at a manageable pace. Think of it as dipping your toes in the water rather than diving into the deep end.
                </p>
              </div>
              
              <div className="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg">
                <h4 className="text-xl font-medium text-white mb-3">3. Resourcing and Grounding</h4>
                <p className="text-gray-300">
                  Before engaging with protective parts (what IFS calls "Firefighters" or "Managers"), we establish resources that help you stay grounded and present. These might include breath awareness, physical grounding techniques, or connecting with supportive internal parts. This creates safety for exploring challenging material.
                </p>
              </div>
              
              <div className="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg">
                <h4 className="text-xl font-medium text-white mb-3">4. Movement and Release</h4>
                <p className="text-gray-300">
                  Sometimes, trauma gets trapped in the body as incomplete defensive responses. I incorporate gentle movement, trembling, or stretching to help release this stored energy, allowing your body to complete these interrupted responses and return to balance.
